Mussel Rock Park, Paragliding Site aka “The Dumps”

Mussel Rock is an amazing flying site. Behind the launches, the cliffs rise as high as 640′ MSL. The soarable cliffs extend to the north and south for a couple miles in each direction. On a good day, the winds are smooth and views of San Francisco and the greater Bay Area can be achieved.

One of the greatest features of this site is the abundant landing area that is virtually rotor free. This is because the plateau area near the launches lies behind a ridge that has a smooth edge without a sharp drop off. At the same time, the nature of the site is quite complex.

The hazards vary based on the wind direction and velocity as well as the rapid changes that can occur with the weather. On one day, the wind can be perfectly steady and 10 MPH at the low cliffs and not much more than 13 MPH up high with virtually no gust factor. On another day, the wind might be 10 MPH and W at the lower launches, but be blowing 20 MPH, some other direction, and extremely gusty at the upper cliffs.

Clear, blue, days are rare during the summer. On some days the fog can be all the way down to the beach, blocking flying completely. On others, the fog can be up above cliff level, with frequent level changes. Continuous monitoring of the fog and winds should become second nature as you fly here.
